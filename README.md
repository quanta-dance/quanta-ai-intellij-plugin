# Quanta AI

Quanta AI is an AI-powered coding assistant designed to integrate with IntelliJ IDEA. This plugin leverages OpenAI models to assist developers with code modifications, reviews, and refactoring directly within the IDE.

## Features

- **Code Review:** Let the AI review your selected code snippets and provide suggestions.
- **Code Refactoring:** Automatically refactor selected code with AI assistance.
- **Add Comments:** Enhance your code with AI-generated comments.
- **Custom AI Prompts:** Execute custom prompts defined by the user.
- **Voice Interaction:** Interact with the AI using voice commands.

## Prerequisites

- IntelliJ IDEA
- An API Key from OpenAI. Generate one at: [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- Your OpenAI account must have a positive balance (OpenAI does not provide free models).

## Installation

## Usage

- Access Quanta AI features through the Editor Popup Menu or Floating Code Toolbar.
